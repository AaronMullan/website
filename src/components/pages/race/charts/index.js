          This chart shows the 20 counties with the highest level of infections
          per capita, and the largest racial or ethnic group in that county.
          White people represent the largest racial group in most of these
          counties. This is in line with Census statistics, which show that more
          than 60 percent of Americans are White, non-Hispanic or Latino.

          When we look at the 20 counties with the highest level of deaths per
          capita, we see a different story. In eight of these 20 counties, Black
          people represent the largest racial groupâ€”and glaringly, the counties
          with the three highest death rates in the nation are all predominantly
          Black.
