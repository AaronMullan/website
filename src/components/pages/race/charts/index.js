        This chart shows the 20 counties with the highest level of infections
        per capita, and the largest racial or ethnic group in that county. White
        people represent the largest racial group in most of these counties.
        This is in line with Census statistics, which show that more than 60
        percent of Americans are White, non-Hispanic or Latino.

        When we look at the 20 counties with the highest level of deaths per
        capita, we see a different story. In eight of these 20 counties, Black
        people represent the largest racial groupâ€”and glaringly, the counties
        with the three highest death rates in the nation are all predominantly
        Black.
